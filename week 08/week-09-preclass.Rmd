## Exercises

1. Read the HTML content of the following URL with a variable called webpage: https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/ At this point, it will also be useful to open this web page in your browser.
```{r}
library("rvest")
library("httr")
webpage=read_html("https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/")
webpage
```
2. Get the session details (status, type, size) of the above mentioned URL.
```{r}
session=html_session("https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/")
session
```
3. Extract all of the sector names from the "stock Sectors"" table (bottom left of the web page.)
```{r}
webpage %>%
  html_nodes(css="table")%>%
  html_table(fill=TRUE) %>%
  .[[2]] %>%
  .[,1]
```
4. Extract all of the "3 Month % Change"" values from the "stock Sectors" table.
```{r}
webpage %>%

  html_table(fill=TRUE) %>%
  .[[2]] %>%
  .[,2]
```

```{r}
webpage %>%
  html_nodes(css="table")%>%
  html_table(fill=TRUE) %>%
  .[[1]]
```
6. Re-construct all of the links from the first column of the ¡°what's Moving" table.
Hint: the base URL is "https://money.cnn.com"
```{r}
url="https://money.cnn.com"
paste(url,html_attr(html_nodes(webpage,"td .wsod_symbol"),"href"))
```
7. Extract the titles under the â€œLatest Newsâ€? section (bottom middle of the web page.)
8. To understand the structure of the data in a web page, it is often useful to know what the underlying attributes are of the text you see.

9. Extract the values of the blue percentage-bars from the â€œTrending Tickersâ€? table (bottom right of the web page.)
Hint: in this case, the values are stored under the â€œclassâ€? attribute.
